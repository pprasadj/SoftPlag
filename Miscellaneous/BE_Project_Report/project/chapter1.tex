\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Problem Statement}
To develop a tool for detecting plagiarism in software source code using
the machine learning algorithms.
\section{Scope of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
\item For the first level of implementation , tool will be on a local machine for
checking plagiarism.
\item The source and target program should be in Java.
\end{itemize}
\section{Current Scenario}

\section{Need for the Proposed System}
The Role of Plagiarism detection in Education, Role of Plagiarism Detection in Software,Industry especially copyright of software.
\section{Summary of the Results / Task completed }
Study of different Research Papers,Thesis on Source Code Plagiarism.
Survey on different source code plagiarism tools.
Implementation upto Level 3 Plagiarism (Rule-based).
